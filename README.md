The project titled "Real Time Human Machine Interaction in Virtual Environment" presents a hand tracking system that enables seamless, controller-free interaction with virtual environments using just a standard webcam. The core innovation is the use of Google’s MediaPipe framework for real-time detection and tracking of 21 hand landmarks in 3D space, combined with OpenCV and CVZone for video processing, and Unity for rendering the user’s hand movements onto a virtual 3D model.
Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined gestures or specialized hardware (like gloves or sensors), this system focuses on gesture-less, natural interaction, allowing users to move their hands freely to manipulate virtual objects with high precision and low latency (~17.12ms). Data is transmitted in real time from the Python hand tracking module to Unity via UDP sockets, ensuring fluid communication and responsiveness.
Key system modules include video capture, pre-processing, hand tracking, data transmission, 3D hand mapping, and interaction within the virtual environment. The architecture eliminates the need for expensive hardware, making the solution cost-effective and accessible. The system achieved a high detection success rate (~90%), low landmark instability (smooth tracking), and robust performance even in diverse lighting conditions.
The project has broad applications in virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR), gaming, educational tools, medical training, and remote collaboration, especially for users with disabilities. Extensive testing at unit, integration, and functional levels confirmed its accuracy and reliability.
Future enhancements suggested include multi-hand tracking, gesture-based command recognition, more advanced physics for object interaction, AI-based prediction for occlusion handling, and support for mobile/AR platforms and haptic feedback.
In summary: The proposed system is a scalable, affordable, and highly immersive solution for real-time human-machine interaction within virtual environments, laying the foundation for more intuitive, accessible, and controller-free digital experiences.
